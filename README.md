# Introducing Myself
Hello! My name is Hannah and I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer and General Assembly graduate with a creative eye for design and a natural inclination for problem solving. I have loved solving mysteries, making discoveries and building things since I was a young child. I have worked in managerial/leadership positions for six+ years, have an extensive background in performance art, am a licensed massage therapist and hold a BS in physiology. 

With over 20 years in the work force, I am a seasoned professional who knows how to dedicate myself to my work and my team. I am driven to deliver clear and concise code that performs well and meets accessibility standards, have a sharp eye for detail and am striving to engineer stylish and well designed layouts. I love learning and am always looking for ways to improve and create systems to optimize workflows and efficiencies.
